                            Laylah's Way is a non-profit organization birthed by L&N group of companies which was
                            established to execute its Corporate Social Responsibilities of reaching out to those
                            amongst us who do not have the privilege and resources at a better life. L&N group of
                            companies is run by Laylah Ali Othman.
                            As a subsidiary of Superb L&N Interior and Exterior Décor Ltd, Laylah's Way began as a
                            reality TV show which focused on reaching out to the less privileged who lived in deplorable
                            conditions. The project involved improving their living condition by giving their homes a
                            total make over by renovation and furnishing. There by creating a more habitable environment
                            for the families, empowering the women and giving scholarships to their children.
                            The beneficiaries of Laylah's way were selected at random after visiting their homes and
                            analysing the situation they were in. This initiative was aimed at creating a more
                            productive environment for the families to thrive better. This medium was also used to
                            showcase the beauty of interior décor with various projects spread all across the country.
                            Over the years, Laylah's Way has served as a mother project which has birthed various

                    <h4>A Brief Background on the Almajiri System of Education</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Almajiri system of education is an informal education system in
                        Northern Nigeria where children from poor socio-economic background are sent to Islamic teachers
                        to receive religious education. This system has been in existence for centuries, dating back to
                        the pre-colonial era. The children at most times stay with teachers or their parents depending
                        on the closeness or proximity to the teacher's abode, for moral upbringing and attend local
                        schools.
                        Inspectors are assigned to each of the schools to provide oversight and report back to the local
                        Emirs. These Schools are funded by authorities, as well as through Zakat, Sadaqah and other
                        sources.
                        However, with the introduction of British colonial system of governance, this particular system
                        became less relevant and people developed less interest in it which consequently led to the
                        removal of many Emirs and the loss of control of their territories as well, the Almajiri system
                        of education.
                        There was an abolishment of the system and the gradual withdrawal of funding for school system
                        and its replacement with western education. This led many students to resort to alms begging and
                        menial labour to survive.
                        Today, it is estimated that there are about 7 million Almajiris which 76% are under the age of
                        18. These children are facing serious deprivations such as lack of basic social amenities, poor
                        quality teaching, and limited access to healthcare. Consequently upon this, many of them have
                        resorted to be political thugs, drug peddlers and other criminal menace leading to the breakdown
                        of the traditional ways of the Almajiri system of education.</p>

                    <h4>Possible Areas of Interventions</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">With this brief introduction of the almajiri system in the northern
                        part of Nigeria, l believed that given an insight into the causes of this problem, it will
                        suffice as tracing the root causes too. Therefore, I would like to proffer some solutions to
                        you, sir, for your consideration.
                        A. Need for Legislation by the National Assembly to create an office with the sole purpose of
                        addressing the Almajiri system of education.
                        B. Proper documentation of all vulnerable children in the streets of all northern states
                        including some states in the South-West, South-East, South-South if any.
                        C. Documentation of all Islamic teachers including taking census of Islamic schools and
                        students.
                        D. Providing a monthly stipend for all teachers and providing meals for the students.
                        E. Allocating some portion of the national feeding programm budget to cater for such
                        unconventional schools.
                        F. Integrating conventional school teachers
                        remodelling the almajiri children and giving them befitting educational carrier.
                        G. Appointing supervisors in each political ward to observe and report to the authorities as the
                        case in pre-colonial times.
                        H. Granting Local Councils and Traditional Rulers the authority to ensure smooth and effective
                        implementation.
                        I. Create offices to address the Almajiri system of education and take lead in changing the
                        present system.
                        If these measures are implemented, Your Excellency, we expect to see a great shift in the
                        perception of the Almajiri system of education in Nigeria
                        .</p>

                    <h4>Possible Methods of Intervention
                    </h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Implementing this proposal might be an uphill task however, with
                        determination and the will and desire to take care of the vulnerable children off the street of
                        different states whose future is uncertain, there can be no service to humanity as great as
                        this.
                        After a careful survey on the issue of reforms in this sector, I identified some major stumbling
                        blocks such as the traditional ruling system especially in the Northern part of the country,
                        their mallams which subverts every efforts of government in futility.
                        Therefore, the below identified methods in tackling these malaise could be deployed.
                        A. Empowering the traditional rulers to lead these reforms in their domains, with the backing of
                        an act of parliament.
                        B. Sensitization programs should be implemented in all to all identified Local Government Areas
                        to educate Malams on the importance of such reforms and provide a small incentive at the end of
                        the workshops.
                        C. Allocation of Land in collaboration with the States to build more schools.
                        D. A pilot project should be carried out in selected Local Government Areas, construction of
                        schools, providing affordable or free healthcare for teachers and students.
                        These and many more are likely to influence the perception of the sector, and the intentions
                        therein.</p>

                    <h4>Advantages of Aggressive Intervention</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is widely accepted that education is the cornerstone of any
                        society, and it is also a well- known fact that majority of Nigeria's population consists of
                        youth and children. Unfortunately, in the northern part of the country, many of these young
                        people are deprived, with no education, making them vulnerable under the manipulation of selfish
                        politicians and extremist groups such as Boko Haram etc.
                        The government has failed in addressing these pathetic issues, instead, it has engaged in a not
                        well thought-out action of awarding foreign scholarships to the children of the wealthy and
                        ignoring the needed.
                        A. Would the Almajiri system of education properly accessed, the potential to provide some far
                        reaching growth could have been achieved in the country which would also have translated in more
                        productive and target-oriented ventures for the youth to tap in.
                        B. Could have drastically reduced crime and political thuggery.
                        C. The nuisance value of the almajiri can as well be turn into productive and essentials for
                        economic growth.
                        D. It could also gained some interventions from non-governmental agencies through donor funding
                        thus taking off some burden from government.</p>

                    <h4>Disadvantages and its attendant consequences</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Often time, children who grow up without adequate care, love and
                        affection from both parents and guardians become a great threat to society. These children may
                        have been exposed to harsh environments, neglect, or even abuse, leading to lack of emotional
                        stability, love and trust in authority (ies).
                        This position is true in some northern part of Nigeria, where child molestation by religious
                        leaders, who are supposed to provide care for young children, are frequently found to abuse such
                        trust given to them by parents of those children.
                        Without a sense of hope, these children sometimes are exposed to criminal activities such as

                        abuse. We also have cases of child molestation that occur throughout the world. Yours sincerely
                        is to state that l have adopted the said child and l am pleased to report that the child is
                        presently doing well, academically and physically indicating that with proper care and show of
                        love, these children will have a better future.</p>

                    </h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        The prospects of tackling the Almajiri system in Nigeria is critical and to the realisation of
                        the objectives of your administration far-reaching goals. Providing access to education,
                        healthcare, and employment opportunities to the vulnerable in the society by your administration
                        can not only eradicate poverty but will enhanced the nation's economic growth. Additionally,
                        increased access to education will foster greater sense of civic engagement and political
                        participation. Your administration's commitment to tackling the Almajiri system is a sure sign
                        of greater promise for the future of Nigeria.
                        History will forever be indebted to you if these momentous reforms are realized during your
                        tenure as President Sir. Your legacy will be one of the first in Nigeria to boldly tackle this
                        formidable challenge.
                        The generations to come will sing your praises for providing them with a new dawn. Nigeria will
                        be the recipient of global recognition for undertaking these reforms, and neighbouring countries
                        will strive to emulate your successful example. Most importantly, the Almighty will bestow his
                        blessings upon you for taking up this noble cause.</p>
